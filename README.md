Snap Behavior Demo
==================
This project shows how to use the **UISnapBehavior** to create a nice, bouncy snap movement animation as shown in the picture. It's a part of the [**Using UISnapBehavior to add some action to your views**](http://wp.me/pSHF7-nr) tutorial.

Try it on the device, you will love it.
